Github is a host website used for the version control system called Git. It helps keep all of the code you create in a cetralized system like a repository so that you may refer to it on remote systems as well as allow others to borrow or help adjust the code that you create. Others are able to create clones of your work as well so that they may use it themselves in the future. A good compatable text editor is webstorm which allows you to create code for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript amoung a few others. From webstorm you are able to commit your work to Github
In order to upload your code, you must commit it from your text editor. Every time you make a new update or change you have the option to push it, meaning you can send the code to the repository you make keeping your code up to date. You may also choose to pull data into your code to help build it up more. You are able to code this information and data into a specific way so it reads how to display the information rather than in a list, which is called a branch.
While making your code, you are able to fetch the information and display it on a local browser to make sure there are no conflicts or mistakes in your code. This can sometimes happen when there is a merge conflict. Merging allows you to combine your code so it is a single set, although sometimes it may not accuratly merge due to said error in code.

GIT - a version-control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

GITHUB - the host for the version control system called git

Repository - a centeralized location for which data can be stored and managed

Clone - to make a exact copy or a file or application

Commit - the act of making a change to a file permanent for a file

Push - when data is sent rather than retrieved, initalized by the server

Pull - when data is requested and retrieved, such as when on the interent

Branch - instructions that tell a computer to execute different instructions rather than executing them in order

Merge - the act of combining two or more groups of data into a single set

Merge Conflict - Changes that is made in the same line, or rather same areas of the file is a hard conflict. When Git cannot determine which version someone wants to keep in the final project. 

Fetch - the process of a program, device or script retrieving data then moving it to display at an alternative location

Remote - accesses a file from somewhere you do not have physical access to, or somewhere you are not the host of but are still able to malipulate
